# The Problem

Meme coins are worth $100 billion—yes, billion. 💰 And what do they stand for? \
A cartoon dog and the same tired punchlines. Meanwhile, the planet is drowning in suffering:

* Millions of unintended pregnancies turning lives upside down 👶
* Birth defects and chronic illnesses ignored by everyone but those living with them 🏥
* Mental health meltdowns treated like bad moods 🧠
* A lack of basic anesthesia leaving people screaming in agony 😫
* Factory farming inflicting unimaginable torment on billions of animals annually 🐮
* Wild animals enduring starvation, disease, predation, and environmental chaos without respite 🦁
* Addiction chaining millions to their next fix, be it a needle, a drink, or another scroll through doom 💉
* Wage slavery, where "living to work" means "dying a little every day" in exchange for crumbs 💸
* Overpopulation's greatest hits: war, starvation, poverty, preventable disease, and a world that's basically on fire 🔥

And what does crypto care about? Dog memes and rocket emojis. 🚀 It's time to shatter the illusion. Painkilla Coin is here to take meme culture hostage and put suffering where it belongs—center stage. 🎭

# The Problem

Meme coins are worth $100 billion—yes, billion. And what do they stand for? A cartoon dog and the same tired punchlines. Meanwhile, the planet is drowning in suffering:

- Millions of unintended pregnancies turning lives upside down.
- Birth defects and chronic illnesses ignored by everyone but those living with them.
- Mental health meltdowns treated like bad moods.
- A lack of basic anesthesia leaving people screaming in agony.
- Factory farming inflicting unimaginable torment on billions of animals annually.
- Wild animals enduring starvation, disease, predation, and environmental chaos without respite.
- Addiction chaining millions to their next fix, be it a needle, a drink, or another scroll through doom.
- Wage slavery, where "living to work" means "dying a little every day" in exchange for crumbs.
- Overpopulation's greatest hits: war, starvation, poverty, preventable disease, and a world that's basically on fire.

And what does crypto care about? Dog memes and rocket emojis. It's time to shatter the illusion. Painkilla Coin is here to take meme culture hostage and put suffering where it belongs—center stage.

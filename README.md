# Introduction

Pain sucks. Life is a meat grinder, and we are the sausages. Society's solution? Scroll past it and pretend it's someone else's problem. Enter **Painkilla Coin**—the first in a series of meme coins designed to hijack the crypto world, and, using humor and satire, drag suffering and pain into the spotlight, making damn sure nobody can look away.

This isn't your cute dog meme coin. Painkilla Coin is savage, unapologetic, and loaded with truth bombs sharp enough to pierce even the thickest bubble of denial.

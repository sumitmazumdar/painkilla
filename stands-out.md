# How Painkilla Stands Out

Inspired by the meteoric rise of GOATEUS MAXIMUS—an AI-driven meme coin that recently hit $500 million in weeks, thanks to a tireless AI agent tweeting on X every two minutes—we're planning to unleash our own digital disruptor. Aptly named **Painkilla**, our future AI overlord will support this project. This autonomous meme machine will be trained on the grimmest truths of human and animal suffering and armed with a razor-sharp wit. Think Schopenhauer with a sense of humor, Nietzsche with a viral tweet, and Buddha if he had Wi-Fi.

Painkilla isn't here to make you feel better. Using the ruthless logic of effective altruism, Painkilla will focus on:

- **The worst pain**: The brutal, gut-wrenching stuff no one wants to talk about.
- **The ignored pain**: Issues ignored by the world because they're inconvenient.
- **The pain we can do something about**: Suffering we actually have the tools to prevent or reduce.
